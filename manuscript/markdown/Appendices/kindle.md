## Reading JavaScript Allongé on Kindle

JavaScript Allongé has over 400 pages and many photographs. For this reason, the `.mobi` version of the book is too big to be sent to your Kinmdle via email, and that is the feature that LeanPub uses when you purchase the book.

So, if you wish to read JavaScript Allongé on your Kindle, please:

1. Download it to your PC or Mac.
2. Use [Send to Kindle for PC](http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/pc) or [Send to Kindle for Mac](http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/mac) to send it to the Kindle.

Thank you!
