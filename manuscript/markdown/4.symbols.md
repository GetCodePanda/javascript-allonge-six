# Interlude in a Coffeehouse: Symbols

Programmers often spend a lot of time trying to define "sameness:" JavaScript programmers know that `"foo" === "foo"` is always true, but `new String("foo") === new String("foo")` is always false, and how tricky it is to define what we mean when we say that `{ foo: "bar" }` is *semantically equivalent* to `{ foo: "bar" }`.
