# JavaScript beyond ES6/ECMAScript 2015

![The Future of Coffee is Black](images/future-of-coffee.jpg)

When this edition was written, ECMAScript 2015 had been standardized, and almost all of its features were available via polyfills and transpilation tools like Babel. Some post-2015 features, like method and class decorators, had not yet been scheduled for inclusion in the language, but were available in transpilers.

Others, such as fully private properties, mixins, and traits, have been discussed and/or proposed. By the time you are reading this, they might be available experimentally, formally approved, or even widely available.

You may have noticed that as teh book progressed, it delved into implementing programming language ideas like method decorators, mixins, and traits. Some books might impement a to-do list, or a content management system, or a MMRPG to provide an opportunity to write example code. This book chooses to explain JavaScript by implementing ideas that hopefully will become standard features by the time you read this.

Many other computer science textbooks do the same thing: They explain how to make a "toy" operating system, or a compiler, or how to make a Lisp in Lisp. And as you have learned, JavaScript is a language strong enough to implement many of its ideas in itself.

So if you are reading this, and thinking, "I don't need to understand how to implement traits, because they will be added to the language eventually, I'll just use them then," or even, "Mixins are in the language already, so I don't need to know how to implement them," consider that the purpose of the examples is to illustrate how to write JavaScript programs by composing smaller pieces in a lightweight fashion.

Whether you actually use these or any implementation is not the point.
