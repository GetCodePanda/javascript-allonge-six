# Closing Time at the Coffeeshop: Final Remarks

![Espresso, Empty](images/espresso-empty.jpg)

We began this book with the bost basic of basic ideas in programming: What is a value? What is a reference to a value? What is a function? What is applying or invoking a function with values?

We then looked at one of the "big ideas" that JavaScript shares with other powerful languages: The idea that functions are values, and thus that you can invoke a function with another function as an argument, and you can return a function from a function.

This led directly to exploring the idea of composing functions: Creating new functions by putting together functions that represent smaller pieces of behaviour. The idea of function decorators emerges naturally from this approach.

From there we went on to explore objects and methods, but underlying our exploration was the constant rediscovery that we can program with objects using the same approach: Composing behaviour out of smaller pieces of behaviour, such as composing object behaviour using delegation.

Naturally we looked at prototypes and classes. And whether we were looking at the underlying mechanism or the `class` syntax available in ECMAScript 2015, we were again exploring ways to compose behaviour. This time it was with mixins, but stepping back we can see that we were working with JavaScript's essential nature by building behaviour out of smaller, focused entities that can be composed with functions.

Although the syntax and semantics of a function are completely different than the syntax and semantics of a generator, which are in turn completely different than the syntax and semantics of a class, all aspects of JavaScript all have one thing in common: **The natural way to write JavaScript programs is through composition**.

To write JavaScript effectively, we need to be mindful of composition and avoid accidentally making it difficult.

### beyond javascript

And just as that idea transcends the ideas around functions, objects, generators, or classes, it transends JavaScript as well. It's a natural style of programming that applies far beyond JavaScript.

If there is one thought we can take with us, it is that this book is not an exploration of JavaScript that happens to include a programming idea: This book is an exploration of a programming idea that happens to be written in JavaScript.
