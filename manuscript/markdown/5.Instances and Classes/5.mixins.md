## Extending Classes with Mixins {#classes-and-mixins}

We've seen that a "class" is simply a constructor function that is associated with a prototype, and that the `class` keyword is a declarative way to write our own constructor functions and prototypes. When we use the `new` keyword, we are invoking a mechanism that creates a new object that delegates to a prototype, just like `Object.create`, and then the constructor function takes over and performs any initialization we desire.

Because "classes" use the exact same model of delegating behaviour to prototypes, all the things we learned about prototypes apply to classes. We saw that we can create "subclasses" by chaining prototypes.

We can also share behaviour between classes in a more flexible way by mixing functionality into classes. This is the exact same thing as mixing functionality into prototypes, of course.

Recall `Person`:

    class Person {
      constructor (first, last) {
        this.rename(first, last);
      }
      fullName () {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
      }
      rename (first, last) {
        this.firstName = first;
        this.lastName = last;
        return this;
      }
    }

    const misterRogers = new Person('Fred', 'Rogers');
    misterRogers.fullName()
      //=> Fred Rogers

We might be building some enterprisey thing and need `Manager` and `Worker`:

    class Manager extends Person {
      constructor (first, last) {
        super(first, last)
      }
      addReport (report) {
        this.reports().add(report);
        return this;
      }
      removeReport (report) {
        this.reports().delete(report);
        return this;
      }
      reports () {
        return this._reports || (this._reports = new Set());
      }
    }

    class Worker extends Person {
      constructor (first, last) {
        super(first, last);
      }
      setManager (manager) {
        this.removeManager();
        this.manager = manager;
        manager.addReport(this);
        return this;
      }
      removeManager () {
        if (this.manager) {
          this.manager.removeReport(this);
          this.manager = undefined;
        }
        return this;
      }
    }

This works for our company, so well that we grow and develop the dreaded "Middle Manager," who both manages people and has a manager of their own. We could subclass `Manager` with `MiddleManager`, but how do `Worker` and `MiddleManager` share the functionality for having a manager?

With a mixin, of course:

    const HasManager = {
      setManager: function (manager) {
        this.removeManager();
        this.manager = manager;
        manager.addReport(this);
        return this;
      },
      removeManager: function () {
        if (this.manager) {
          this.manager.removeReport(this);
          this.manager = undefined;
        }
        return this;
      }
    };
    
    class Manager extends Person {
      constructor (first, last) {
        super(first, last)
      }
      addReport (report) {
        this.reports().add(report);
        return this;
      }
      removeReport (report) {
        this.reports().delete(report);
        return this;
      }
      reports () {
        return this._reports || (this._reports = new Set());
      }
    }
    
    class MiddleManager extends Manager {
      constructor (first, last) {
        super(first, last);
      }
    }
    Object.assign(MiddleManager.prototype, HasManager);
    
    class Worker extends Person {
      constructor (first, last) {
        super(first, last);
      }
    }
    Object.assign(Worker.prototype, HasManager);
    
We can mix functionality into the prototypes of "classes" just as easily as we can mix functionality directly into objects, because prototypes *are* objects, and JavaScript builds its "classes" out of prototypes.

Were classes "something else," like they are in other languages, we would gain many advantages that we do not enjoy in JavaScript, but we would also give up the flexibility of being able to use the same tools and techniques on prototypes that we do on objects.

### reducing conflicts

Consider `IsAuthor`, a mixin for `Person' (and any other class that might represent authors):

~~~~~~~~
const IsAuthor = {
  addBook (name) {
    this._books.push(name);
    return this;
  },
  books () {
    return this._books;
  }
};
~~~~~~~~

And consider `Bibliophile`, a mixin representing book collectors:

~~~~~~~~
const Bibliophile = {
  addBookToCollection (name) {
    this._books.push(name);
    return this;
  },
  collection () {
    return this._books;
  }
};
~~~~~~~~

Although there is no conflict between the methods both mixins provide, there is a conflict between their state: Both use the `_books` property. Note how the books Isaac Asimov has written and collects have become intermingled:

~~~~~~~~
const IsAuthor = (function () {
  const books = Symbol();
  
  return {
    addBook (name) {
      this.books().push(name);
      return this;
    },
    books () {
      return this[books] || this[books] = [];
    }
  };
})();

const Bibliophile = (function () {
  const books = Symbol();
  
  return {
    addBookToCollection (name) {
      this.collection().push(name);
      return this;
    },
    collection () {
      return this[books] || this[books] = [];
    }
  };
})();

Object.assign(Person.prototype, IsAuthor, Bibliophile);

new Person('Isaac', 'Asimov')
  .addBook('I Robot')
  .addBookToCollection('The Mysterious Affair at Styles')
  .collection()
    //=> ["I Robot","The Mysterious Affair at Styles"]
~~~~~~~~

We can correct this problem using symbols, as we saw with creating [privacy with symbols](#privacy-with-symbols) earlier:

~~~~~~~~
const IsAuthor = (function () {
  const books = Symbol();
  
  return {
    addBook (name) {
      this.books().push(name);
      return this;
    },
    books () {
      return this[books] || (this[books] = []);
    }
  };
})();

const Bibliophile = (function () {
  const books = Symbol();
  
  return {
    addBookToCollection (name) {
      this.collection().push(name);
      return this;
    },
    collection () {
      return this[books] || (this[books] = []);
    }
  };
})();

Object.assign(Person.prototype, IsAuthor, Bibliophile);

new Person('Isaac', 'Asimov')
  .addBook('I Robot')
  .addBookToCollection('The Mysterious Affair at Styles')
  .collection()
    //=> ["The Mysterious Affair at Styles"]
~~~~~~~~

The conflict is gone. Using techniques to keep mixin state private reduces conflicts between mixins, other mixins, classes, and other classes. This also reduces coupling as it discourages writing mxins or subclasses that rely on the private state of other mixins or classes.
